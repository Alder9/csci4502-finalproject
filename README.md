# PUBG Data Royale
Final Project for CSCI 4502 - Data Mining

Team Members: Thomas Alder, Federico Aragon, Matthew Davenport, Haotian Dong

## Description
  In this project we are looking to analyze data from the results of a player’s matches they played in a Battle Royale video game named PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds. Using this dataset, we hope to answer questions regarding the game’s mechanisms through an analysis of of player damage and deaths and how this statistic could be improved. Mainly, we are looking for the the best method and details which will lead to a win. Through analyzing the data of over 720,000 matches, we are going to try to understand the ways in which winners of these matches were able to obtain the fabled “Winner Winner Chicken Dinner”. Find the best strategy to use when playing the game in terms of determining the most dangerous places to avoid, places which may be beneficial, and the general strategy of players that tend to win more will help us define a general strategy to try and gains the most wins.


## Questions Sought
* Where should you land?
* What locations should you avoid?
* What are the best weapons to pick up?
* How far away should I be before engaging in a fight?
* How big should our squad be?
* Should I drive a vehicle or walk when going to a new location?


## Application of Knowledge
  The main application of our findings is applying them while playing the game. Since our goal was to find the most effective methods to reach first place, players can apply tactics based on the findings to gain an upper hand on opponents. In addition, its growth as a viable eSport means that teams that compete competitively can too use findings like these to understand the game further and what it takes to win. In general players should be aiming for doing at least as good as the “average” winner, whos results can be seen above. In addition, these players should also keep in mind that assault rifles tend to get the most kills, making them the most effective weapon type in the game, and they should avoid any named locations on the map in order to stay alive as long as possible.
